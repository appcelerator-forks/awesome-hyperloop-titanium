## A curated list of awesome links to resources around Axway's Hyperloop for Titanium

**What is Hyperloop?**

Use any native API via JavaScript
Anything you can write in Objective-C, Swift, Java, or C# can be represented with JavaScript.

**What is this repo for?**

There's so much awesomeness about Hyperloop, but it's difficult to find an aggregated spot of up-to-date information about it.

This repo is an attempt to bridge that gap and link the community to relevant information so that we can make more badass software!

**Cool!  What can I do?**

>At the TitaniumNL meetup in Amsterdam at February 3rd, Hans Knoechel talked about Hyperloop and what Hyperloop actually is.
In short, Hyperloop allows you to talk from Javascript straight to Objective-C/Swift or Java without having to write wrapper modules. This makes it really really easy to extend native APIâ€™s for Titanium.
The presentation has been recorded and can be seen in full on YouTube.
